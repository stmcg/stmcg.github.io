*  [CausalMetaR](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=CausalMetaR): An R package for performing causally interpretable meta-analyses
*  [smoothedIPW](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=smoothedIPW): An R package for time-smoothed inverse probability weighting for repeatedly measured outcomes
*  [learner](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=learner): An R package for latent space-based transfer learning
*  [learner-py](https://pypi.org/project/learner-py/): A Python package for latent space-based transfer learning
*  [metamedian](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=metamedian): An R package for meta-analyzing studies reporting medians
*  [estmeansd](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=estmeansd): An R package for estimating mean and standard deviations from commonly reported quantiles in meta-analysis

Other packages I have contributed to are:

*  [pygformula](https://pypi.org/project/pygformula): A Python package for the parametric g-formula
*  [gfoRmulaICE](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gfoRmulaICE): An R package for the parametric iterative conditional expectation g-formula

I am currently developing the following packages:
