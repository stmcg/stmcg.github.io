*  [CausalMetaR](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=CausalMetaR): An R package for performing causally interpretable meta-analyses
*  [learner](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=learner): An R package for latent space-based transfer learning
*  [learner-py](https://pypi.org/project/learner-py/): A Python package for latent space-based transfer learning
*  [metamedian](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=metamedian): An R package for meta-analyzing studies reporting medians
*  [estmeansd](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=estmeansd): An R package for estimating mean and standard deviations from commonly reported quantiles in meta-analysis

I am currently developing the following packages: 

*  [smoothedIPW](https://github.com/stmcg/smoothedIPW): An R package for time-smoothed inverse probability weighting for repeatedly measured outcomes
*  [iai](https://github.com/stmcg/iai): An R package for incomplete auxiliaries in imputation

Other packages I have contributed to are:
