I'm a postdoctoral research fellow in the [Department of Population Medicine](https://www.populationmedicine.org/) at Harvard Medical School and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute. 

I'm a biostatistician and my research focuses on developing and applying statistical methods for causal inference and evidence synthesis. I also actively work on developing open-source statistical software in these domains.
